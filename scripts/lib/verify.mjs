/**
 * The verification toolkit: the reporting vocabulary, the readers over `dist/`,
 * and every assertion that more than one suite needs to run.
 *
 * There are two suites, and the split is the point of this module existing.
 *
 *   scripts/verify-build.mjs   over a finished `dist/`, and nothing else. It
 *                              runs inside `npm run build`, on every user's
 *                              site, so every check in it has to be one whose
 *                              failure is jotter's fault.
 *   scripts/verify-theme.mjs   rebuilds this repository under configurations
 *                              nobody ships (features off, analytics on, a
 *                              1,000-note vault) and asserts against fixtures
 *                              that exist in the demo garden and nowhere else.
 *                              Maintenance. It never runs on a user's site.
 *
 * They used to be one 3,900-line script behind a `--full` flag, and the cost of
 * that is written into its own docstring: a real user hit eight failures, five
 * of them anti-vacuity guards about fixtures only this repository has, and
 * removed the build gate from their build command. Their site is live and
 * unverified. A gate a user is right to delete is worse than no gate, and the
 * durable fix is that the checks they cannot pass are not in the script they
 * run.
 *
 * ## Three kinds of claim, and only one of them stops a deploy
 *
 *   check()    an **invariant**. Something jotter guarantees about every site
 *              it builds: a dead link is inert, a page has a `<main>`, the
 *              canonical spells the URL the links do. A failure is a defect in
 *              this theme, and the build stops.
 *
 *   observe()  an **observation**. Something true of the built site that the
 *              author decided: how many origins their notes embed from,
 *              whether every image they wrote carries dimensions. Reported,
 *              named, and then the build carries on.
 *
 *   demo()     a **demo-integrity guard**. "The demo still exercises this, so
 *              the assertion beside it is not passing on an empty set." A claim
 *              about *this repository*, and it runs only when this repository's
 *              own demo garden is what was built.
 *
 * Every check added anywhere should be able to answer: *whose fault is it when
 * this fails, and should that person's site stop shipping over it?*
