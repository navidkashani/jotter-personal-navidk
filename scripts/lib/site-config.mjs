/**
 * The snapshot's `site` block, as the options overlay a jotter build reads.
 *
 * Open Publish's site options are deliberately generator-agnostic *intent*
 * ("show a graph", not "render `LocalGraph.astro` in the right panel"), so the
 * mapping to any one generator is where the intent either lands or quietly
 * does nothing. Three of the sixteen keys are traps in exactly that way, and
 * each is handled below with the reason attached:
 *
 * - **`showGraph`** is not enough on its own. `astro.config.ts` gates the graph
 *   island on `features.graph && layout === 'panels'`, because the graph lives
 *   in the right panel and there is no right panel in the column layout. Asking
 *   for a graph therefore also asks for `layout: 'panels'`.
 * - **`analytics`** is build-breaking. The plugin defaults `id` to `''`, and
 *   `src/lib/config.ts` refines `id` as *required* unless the provider is
 *   `none`, so a provider chosen and an id left blank in Obsidian would fail
 *   the whole build on a config error, which is the wrong place for that
 *   sentence to appear. It falls back to `none`, loudly.
 * - **`showNavigation`** is a boolean here and a three-valued enum in jotter
 *   (`tree` | `tags` | `none`). `true` means `tree`; there is no plugin option
 *   that means `tags`.
 * - **`nav`** collides by name with that enum, so the arrangement it carries
 *   lands on two keys of jotter's own, `navOrder` and `navHidden`. Both are
 *   omitted when empty, so a site nobody has arranged generates the same config
 *   file it generated before this option existed.
 *
 * The other keys map straight across, except `homepage`, which is *already*
 * applied: it is a vault path, and the plugin has given that note the slug
 * `index`, which `src/lib/site.ts` picks up on its own. Re-deriving it here
 * would be a second answer to a question that already has one.
 *
 * A key jotter does not understand is reported rather than guessed at: that
 * is how somebody finds out their site is running a jotter older than the
 * plugin that published to it. See `docs/updating.md`.
 */

/**
 * Every site option this starter understands, with the plugin's own default.
 *
 * The snapshot is merged **over** these rather than replacing them, and that
 * matters: a snapshot published by an older plugin will not carry keys added
 * since, `undefined` is falsy, and replacing wholesale would silently switch
 * off search, navigation and backlinks on somebody's live site.
