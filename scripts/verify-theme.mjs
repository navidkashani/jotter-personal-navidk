 * At whatever `jotter.config.ts` currently says, which is the honest thing
 * for it to do: a forker running this gets their own feature set measured.
 *
 * On the committed default that means **search is off here**, so Pagefind's
 * indexing time is not in the 60s number below. Measured by hand once, at
 * this same 1,000-note vault: 597ms to index and 380ms to write, so about
 * **1.0s**, against a 60s envelope: 1.7%, and it does not grow with the
 * number of *pages* so much as with the amount of prose. The index directory
 * lands at 4.2 MB, none of which a reader downloads until they search.
 *
 * Left off rather than forced on, because a second before the ceiling cannot
 * be what fails this check, and a Pagefind regression at scale is Pagefind's
 * to catch. Turn `features.search` on in your own config and this pass covers
 * it for free. Re-measure if that 1.0s is ever load-bearing.
