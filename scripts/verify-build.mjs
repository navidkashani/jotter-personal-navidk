 * Assertions over a real `dist/`, run after `astro build`.
 *
 * These are the claims jotter makes that a unit test cannot check, because they
 * are only true of the finished HTML: that a dead link is inert, that no
 * unpublished note leaked, that the palette meets AA, that a disabled feature
 * ships no JavaScript, and that Astro 7's `compressHTML: 'jsx'` default did not
 * quietly eat the spaces between inline elements.
 *
 *   npm run verify   the checks below, over the current dist/
 *
 * **Everything here reads `dist/` and nothing else.** It builds nothing,
 * rewrites nothing and needs no fixture, which is what makes it safe to leave
 * in `npm run build` on somebody else's site. The passes that rebuild this
 * repository under configurations nobody ships live in
 * `scripts/verify-theme.mjs` and never run on a user's site; see the docstring
 * in `scripts/lib/verify.mjs` for why the two are separate files.
 *
 * The vocabulary — `check`, `observe`, `demo`, and which of them stops a
 * deploy — is defined there too.

 * files that quietly write one page. Whichever renders second wins, `dist/`
 * shows no sign of it, and every other assertion in this script passes.
 *
 * Two nets, because a collision is visible in two different places and neither
 * sees the other's case:
 *
 * 1. **The source tree**, for two static route files sharing an output path.
 *    That is the pair above, and it cannot be seen in `dist/` at all: there is

 * 2. **`dist/` itself**, for two files serving one address. That is a mixed or
 *    stale output directory (`about.html` left beside `about/index.html` by a
 *    build under the other format), where the host picks one and the other is
 *    unreachable.
 *
 * The third kind of collision, a note and a folder claiming one slug, is not
 * here: `src/pages/[...slug].astro` resolves it deliberately (the note wins)
