/**
 * The local graph, drawn.
 *
 * `src/lib/` is build-time code: it imports `node:fs`. This directory is the
 * other side of that boundary: everything here runs in a browser, and nothing
 * here may be imported by a page.
 *
 * A force layout on a 2D canvas. `d3-force` does the physics and the rest is
 * hand-written, including pan, zoom and drag. That last part is not taste:
 * `d3-zoom` pulls in selection, transition, interpolate, ease and color, and
 * takes the shipped bundle from 17 KB to 78 KB (three times the whole theme's
 * budget) for behaviour that is sixty lines here.
 *
 * Sizing follows Quartz, which is tuned for exactly this box: radius
 * `2 + sqrt(links)`, no node cap.
 *
 * The labelling does not, and that is worth being precise about, because this
 * file used to argue the opposite. Quartz hides labels at rest (their opacity
 * is `max((k - 1) / 3.75, 0)`, which at its own starting zoom is *zero*), and
 * that was taken as the rule. But the reference this theme is measured
 * against, `navidk.com/start`, is not Quartz: it is Obsidian Publish, and
 * Obsidian draws every label, always. Two products, opposite defaults, and
 * copying the wrong one left the rail card a picture with no names on it.
 *
 * So: every label, always. What makes that affordable is the same thing that
 * makes it affordable for Obsidian: the expand button, and the dialog behind
 * it. The card is a glanceable map; the dialog is where you read.
 *
 * The card is also the harder problem of the two. Obsidian gives its graph
 * 290px and still lets "Wisdom & Approaches" run into "Now"; jotter's rail is
 * 216px and its titles are longer, so "just make the type smaller" would put
 * it below every size in `tokens.css` and *still* overlap. Four things buy the
 * room back instead: the labels are set in the body sans rather than the mono
 * (about 17% narrower, and mixed-case titles read better in it anyway); they
 * are elided to a budget that scales with the box, so the rail trims and the
 * dialog never does; the halo below keeps whatever still overlaps readable;
 * and a soft separation force tiles them into rows rather than stacks. The
 * hovered node draws its full title over the top, which is what makes eliding
 * the rest safe.
 *
 * The list underneath names all of them, always, for anyone who would rather
 * read than point.
 *
 * Colours are read from the computed style rather than written here, so the
 * canvas obeys `tokens.css` like everything else and the build's "no colour
 * literal outside tokens.css" assertion keeps meaning something.
