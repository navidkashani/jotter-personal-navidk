/**
 * Hover previews: the card.
 *
 * Like `local-graph.ts`, this is the browser side of the boundary. Nothing here
 * may import from `src/lib/` (that is build-time code and it reaches for
 * `node:fs`), and nothing here is imported by a page.
 *
 * Everything it shows is already in the page. `src/markdown/wikilinks.ts` put
 * `data-preview-title` and `data-preview` on the anchor at build time, so there
 * is nothing to fetch, nothing to await, nothing to cache and no race to guard
 * against. Quartz's `popover.inline.ts` needs all four because it fetches; the
 * build asserts that jotter never does.
 *
 * It puts `data-preview-title-dir` and `data-preview-dir` there too, when the
 * note being previewed runs the other way from the site. The card is appended
 * to `document.body`, so its own position in the DOM can only ever tell it the
 * *site's* direction; the direction of the note it is showing has to travel
 * with the words. Absent is the common case and means "agrees with the page".
 *
 * Three things it takes from Quartz anyway: the card stays open while the
 * pointer is *on* it (WCAG 1.4.13 *hoverable*), the whole feature is off for
 * touch, and the delay is real hover intent rather than a CSS `animation-delay`:
 * Quartz's fetch still fires on every `mouseenter`; nothing happens here
 * until the intent is confirmed.
 *
 * 400ms is inside the researched band. Wikipedia settled on 500ms after A/B
 * tests on three wikis and Nielsen Norman recommends 300–500ms, scaled to how
 * disruptive the thing that appears is. This card is lighter than Wikipedia's
 * (no image, no scroll), and has no network latency to hide.

 * is correct by construction. The JavaScript alternative wants
 * `getBoundingClientRect().left`, which is physically wrong in RTL and passes
 * the build's physical-property lint only because `.ts` files are not scanned.
