/**
 * Search: the modal.
 *
 * The browser side of the boundary, like `local-graph.ts` and
 * `hover-preview.ts`. The one import from `src/lib/` is deliberate and narrow:
 * `src/lib/search.ts` imports nothing at all and touches no global, which is
 * what lets every decision in it be unit-tested without a DOM. Nothing else
 * here may reach across.
 *
 * As much as possible lives over there, and the split is on purpose: this file
 * has no test harness: `vitest` runs on `environment: 'node'` and there is no
 * jsdom, so anything left here is verified by hand or not at all. What stays
 * is element creation, event wiring and the async flow. What leaves is every
 * question with a right answer: which URL a result points at, which sections
 * survive, where an arrow key goes, whether a keystroke belongs to a field.
 *
 * **This script builds its own chrome, including the trigger button.** Nothing
 * renders it server-side, for the reason `local-graph.ts` already gives for its
 * expand button: a search box that does nothing with scripting off is worse
 * than no search box. With scripting off there is no button, no dialog, and the
 * header is exactly what it was before the feature existed.
 *
 * **Pagefind is loaded lazily and fails to nothing.** The runtime arrives on
 * first open, the index warms while the reader is still typing, and a rejected
 * import (no index built yet, `astro dev` on a fresh checkout) shows a quiet
 * message instead of throwing.
