/**
 * Wikilink and embed resolution.
 *
 * Three outcomes per link, matching Quartz's `CrawlLinks` and the mockup:
 *   published    -> a real `<a>`
 *   unpublished  -> an inert `<span class="dead-link">`
 *   unresolved   -> an inert `<span class="dead-link">`
 *
 * A dead link is a `<span>` and not an `<a href="">` because a link that goes
 * nowhere is worse than no link: it takes focus, it takes a click, and it lies.
 *
 * The privacy rule: a dead link never renders an unpublished note's *title*.
 * When the author wrote an alias we show the alias; otherwise we show the
 * basename of the target they typed. `My Very Private Title` stays in the vault.

   * pasted a link did not ask to put Google's script on their readers' page.
   * A facade honours that rather than overturning it, because the reader's
   * click is the consent, and until they click the page has fetched nothing

   *
   * The element is an `<a>` to the video, so this is also its own `noscript`
   * answer: with JavaScript off, or before the island loads, the facade is a
   * link that works. `src/scripts/embed.ts` intercepts the click and swaps in
   * the player; nothing here depends on it having run.
   *
   * The poster is served from this site. `lite-youtube-embed` is the standard
   * solution to this problem and could not be used: it fetches its thumbnail
   * from `i.ytimg.com` at runtime, which is exactly the request the origin
   * assertion in `scripts/verify-build.mjs` exists to forbid. So the poster is
   * downloaded at build time instead, and its absence is survivable: no
   * `.jotter/embeds.json`, no network when the vault was fetched, or a video
   * whose thumbnail 404s, and the facade is a labelled panel rather than a
   * broken one.
   *
   * A `<span>` rather than a `<div>` for the reason `doc-embed` gives: an embed
   * that is not alone in its paragraph stays inside the `<p>`, where a `<div>`
   * is invalid nesting. The block layout is CSS's job.

   * that nobody has to rediscover it:
   *
   *   - it downloads the whole file on page load, and **`loading="lazy"` does
   *     not stop it**. Measured, not assumed: Chrome 152, a frame 15,000px
   *     below the fold, a logging server counting what it actually wrote. All
   *     519,123 bytes of the PDF went over the wire before the reader had
   *     scrolled once. `<img loading="lazy">` on the same page deferred
   *     correctly, so the attribute works and frames are the exception; a
   *     closed `<details>` and `display: none` defer nothing either. Only
   *     withholding `src` does, and that is JavaScript, which the README
   *     promises a feature-off build does not ship. The attribute stays
   *     because it is the correct declaration and costs nothing, but nothing
   *     here should be read as a claim that the bytes are deferred today: the
   *     page that reported this carries 456 KB of PDF against a 32 KB
   *     per-page JavaScript cap whose heaviest real page spends 28 KB.
   *   - mobile browsers render it as a blank box. `<iframe>` has no fallback
   *     content in static markup, so the link beside it is *always* visible
   *     rather than fallback: a phone that refuses the document would otherwise
   *     leave a reader with a blank box and no way forward.
   *   - the browser's own full-window viewer beats a pane in the page, for
   *     anybody who actually wants to read the thing. That is what the link
   *     opens.
   *
   * `#page=3` and `#height=400` are Obsidian's documented options for exactly
   * this embed. The height sizes the frame; the rest rides through to the URL
   * fragment, which the browser's viewer reads by itself.
   *
   * A *remote* document stays a card. An `<iframe>` of somebody else's origin
   * is a third party in the reader's page, which is the same reason a remote
   * embed naming no image is a link and not a frame.
   *
   * Video and audio keep their players, because those elements exist, cost no
   * JavaScript and stream rather than download. `preload="metadata"` is what
   * keeps the promise the byte budget makes: a header, not the file.
