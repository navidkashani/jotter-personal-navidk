/**
 * Which way a piece of text runs, and whether that is worth saying out loud.
 *
 * jotter has always had exactly one direction for the whole site
 * (`config.dir`, spent in one place, on `<html>`), so a vault that mixes scripts
 * has no correct setting. An English site with Persian paragraphs in it renders
 * them left-aligned with their terminal punctuation thrown to the wrong end of
 * every line, and an Arabic site with English notes in it has the mirror
 * problem. There is no third setting that fixes either.
 *
 * The answer is per block, and it is one rule rather than two code paths:
 * **mark the blocks whose direction differs from the page's.** The majority
 * language is never marked, whichever one it is, which is what makes the
 * feature symmetric and what makes a single-script vault of *either* direction
 * pay exactly nothing: `textDir` returns `undefined`, Astro drops an
 * `undefined` attribute, and `ctx.setProperty` is never called.
 *
 * ## Why the answer is computed here rather than deferred to `dir="auto"`
 *
 * Obsidian Publish sets `dir="auto"` on every block and lets the browser run
 * the algorithm, because Publish *is* a browser renderer. jotter renders ahead
 * of time, so it emits the answer it already knows. Two consequences decide it:
 * `dir="auto"` is unassertable: a Persian paragraph and an English one produce
 * byte-identical markup, so no build check can tell a right answer from a shrug;
 * and a single-script vault pays nothing here and would pay an attribute per
 * block there.
 *
 * There used to be a third, that an explicit `dir` keeps the `[dir='rtl']`
 * selectors in `base.css` matching, so no `:dir()` migration and no CSS. That
 * one has been spent, and it was always the weakest: an *ancestor* `[dir='rtl']`
 * can only ever match `<html dir>`, so it could never see the per-block
 * direction this module exists to compute, and the rules that needed to see it
 * have moved to `:dir()`. The two above are unaffected, and neither was ever
 * about CSS. `src/styles/prose.css` records the migration and what it costs.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * Pure first-strong: UBA rules P2 and P3, the same rule `dir="auto"` runs and
 * the same one Obsidian's editor has used per line since 1.6. Agreeing with the
 * editor matters more than being cleverer than it: the published page then
 * always looks like what the author saw while writing. A majority-of-characters
 * rule was tried, and rejected for diverging from the editor (it was also 7×
 * slower).
 *
 * It gets exactly one case wrong (a sentence opening with a word from the
 * other script, `Obsidian یک برنامه است`), and Obsidian gets that wrong too.
 * The escape hatch is `direction:` in the note's frontmatter, below.
 *
 * Pure, DOM-free and `node:fs`-free, the rule `src/lib/social.ts`,
 * `src/lib/analytics.ts` and `src/lib/feed.ts` already state in their
 * docstrings: vitest runs `environment: 'node'` and there is no jsdom, so
 * everything decidable lives where a unit test can reach it.

 * paragraph right-to-left. Enumerating the RTL side instead makes every script
 * jotter has never heard of correct by default.
