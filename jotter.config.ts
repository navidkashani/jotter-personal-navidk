 * Yours. Along with `src/styles/custom.css`, `src/user/*.astro`, your vault

 * in the build writes to any of them**. That is what makes updating jotter a
 * button rather than a merge.
 *
 * Every field is optional. `defineConfig({})` builds a working site.
 *
 * `generated ??` is for sites fed by Open Publish: there the options come from
 * Obsidian, are written to `.jotter/site.json` on every build, and replace this
 * literal outright rather than merging with it. See `src/lib/generated.ts` for
 * why replacement is the only correct answer. Edit below anyway if you like: the
 * file is yours, it is never overwritten, and it is what a build with no
 * snapshot uses.
