/**
 * Building jotter from an Open Publish snapshot.
 *
 * The scripts under `scripts/` are the only part of this repository that talks
 * to a network, rewrites `jotter.config.ts` and deletes a directory, so they
 * are tested against a real bucket rather than a mocked reader: a `node:http`
 * server on `127.0.0.1` speaking enough S3 to answer a GET. Path-style
 * addressing is the default, so `OP_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:<port>` reaches
 * it, and the server ignores the signature: what is being tested here is what
 * the build does with a snapshot, not whether SigV4 works, which the first
 * block below covers on its own.
 *
 * The seam these scripts exist to use is `src/lib/links-index.ts`, and the
 * shapes on either side of it are asserted here rather than described: the
 * plugin's `SnapshotLink` and jotter's `IndexedLink` are field for field the
 * same record, and `parseLinksIndex` already accepts the manifest's own
 * `{ links: {...} }` envelope.
