/**
 * Assertions about the shape of the source, not about what it does.
 *
 * Six bugs of one shape have now been found by hand: `analytics`,
 * `features.rss`, frontmatter `homepage: true` and `image:` were each declared
 * and read by nothing, and `calloutIcon`, `enabledFeatures` and `aliasRedirects`
 * were each written and called by nobody. Every one was invisible for the same
 * reason: nothing compared the list of things jotter *offers* against the list
 * of things jotter *uses*, so a promise with no reader looked exactly like a
 * promise being kept.
 *
 * These two tests are that comparison, and they are the reason the seventh does
 * not need to be found by reading the repository.
 *
 * Its own file, and the corpus below excludes it, deliberately: the exemption
 * lists name the very symbols they exempt, so a scan that read this file would
 * count each mention as a reader and pass for exactly the wrong reason.
